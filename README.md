### Projects
[**World Co2 Exploration**](https://github.com/Kanustu/world_co2)
- Used postgresql for data exploration of World Co2 data
- Used Python for data exploration and examination of Co2 data

[**First Glance**](https://github.com/Kanustu/first_glance)
- Successfully built Python package that can return quick insights with the use of two commands:
    - stats_report, which will provide a dataframe with nullrows, datatype, and descriptive stats for the numeric columns within the data provided
    - plot_analysis, which will provide boxplots, histograms, and a heatmap based on the numeric columns within the data provided

[**CityBikes Statistical Modeling**](https://github.com/Kanustu/CityBikes-Statistical-Modeling)
- Conducted statistical analysis with python on data collected from multiple sources, including the CityBikes, Foursquare and Yelp API's.
- Attempted to find a correalation between bike availabilty and the ratings and locations of businesses within a major city centre.
